\textbf{1.} In a training exercise, athletes run from a starting point
to an from a series o points, $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$..., increasingly far away in a straight line. In the exercise, athletes start at O and run stage 1 from O to $A_1$ and back to O, then stage 2 from O to $A_2$ and back to O, and so on. \\

(ai) In version 1 of the exercise, the distance between adjacent points are all 4m. Find the distance run by an athlete who completes the first IO stages of Version 1 of the exercise.
\begin{flushright} [2m] \end{flushright} 


(aii) Write down an expression for the distance run by an athlete who completes n stages of Version 1. Hence find the least number of stages that the athlete needs to complete to run at least 5 km.
\begin{flushright} [4m] \end{flushright} 


(b) In Version 2 of the exercise, the distances between the points are such that $OA_1$ = 4m, $A_1A_2$ = 8, and $A_nA_{n+1} = 2A_{n-1}A_n$. Write down an expression for the distance run by an athlete who completes n stages of Version 2. Hence find the distance from O, and the direction of travel, of the athlete after he has run exactly 10 km using Version 2. \begin{flushright} [5m] \end{flushright}
